FINGERPRINT DOOR LOCK CODE.

Equipments used in project: Arduino nano,R305 fingerprint sensor module,motors,rack and pinion mechanism for lock.

Coding done in arduino IDE.


There are three .ino files in the master repository which are used for fingerprint matching using r305 fingerprint sensor module.

1.finger_door_lock.ino -> This file consist of methods to detect a finger print and execute methods required for the opening and closing of the door lock.

2.finger.ino -> consist of setup() method which initializes the pin number for the finger print sensors and the motors.

3.motor.ino -> consist of methods to rotate the motors in either clockwise or anti-clockwise direction based on input by the finger print sensor.
